#TextMasterPy Documentation  

**TextMasterPy** is a powerful Python framework designed for text analysis and processing, primarily targeting **English** and **Arabic** languages.  
It consists of **33 generic functions**, categorized into three main groups:  


General Processing Functions: Applicable to both English and Arabic.

English-Specific Functions: Dedicated functions for English language processing.

Arabic-Specific Functions: Functions tailored for Arabic language text processing.

This framework is designed for Python 3.12.7 and relies on Python's built-in modules string and re for enhanced text manipulation.

Key Features

Handles both English and Arabic texts with robust text processing capabilities.
Built-in text cleaning to remove extra spaces, special characters, and stop words.
Supports regex operations but keeps functions flexible for broader text analysis.
Lightweight & Efficient: Uses only built-in Python modules (string, re).
Regular Updates: The framework will be continuously improved and updated.
